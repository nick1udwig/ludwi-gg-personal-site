I publish technical notes and documentation as public gists.
Topics have historically included:

- **Distributed systems & blockchain:** State synchronization strategies, indexing infrastructure, and tokenomics design for Hyperware
- **AI agent architectures:** Specialist prompt selection, agent-based systems, and development roadmaps
- **Development tooling:** Design-to-UI workflows, backend patterns, and remote compilation infrastructure
